A Franzbrötchen is a traditional sweet pastry from Hamburg, Germany.
It resembles a flattened cinnamon roll, made with buttery dough, generously filled with sugar and cinnamon, and sometimes topped with raisins or chocolate.
Its texture is flaky and soft, similar to a croissant.

The store Mutterland is located in Hamburg and has multiple branches.
One popular location is near Hamburg's central train station (Hauptbahnhof), at Ernst-Merck-Straße 9, known for its focus on high-quality, regional products and specialty foods, including Franzbrötchen.

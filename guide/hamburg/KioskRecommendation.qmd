Visit Bigis!! The owner is very friendly and it's fun to just sit in front of the kiosk, talk to new people and enjoy a nice cold beverage :) Great way to start a night out or to just hang. 'Papa' as we like to call him is always down for a chat, he even said we're like family (even though he doesn't always remember who we are lol) - hence the name. It's located in the Schanze and always worth a visit.

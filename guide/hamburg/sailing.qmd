##  Where

If you have some sailing experience, it is easy to rent a sailing boat at one of the many sailing rental companies around the Außenalster. 
I usually start at Bobby Reich in the north of the lake.

## When 

Unfortunately, there is lots of rain in Hamburg especially in fall, winter and spring. So check the weather forecast before.
